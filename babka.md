- Tangzhong info mostly from [King Arthur Baking](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2018/07/23/how-to-convert-a-bread-recipe-to-tangzhong). As a rough estimate, the tangzhong "consumes" ~40% of the water included in the slurry.

## Dough

- 636g AP flour (36g for tangzhong, 600g bulk)
- 200g milk (180g for tangzhong, 20g bulk)
- 70g sugar
- 12g salt
- 3 tsp yeast
- 5 eggs
- 14 tbsp butter (room temp)

### Steps:
1. Make tangzhong
2. Combine tangzhong, remaining flour, remaining milk, sugar, salt, yeast, and eggs in mixer with *bread hook* attachment. Mix until it looks sorta dough-like. Note: if using active dry yeast, you may want to bloom the yeast in the 20g of milk first to ensure it dissolves fully.
3. Add the butter a few tablespoons at a time, mixing between each addition until dough is soft.
4. Continue mixing until it passes window pane test. It may help to let it rest (covered) for 20-30 mins before testing.
5. Fold 1x after a couple hours?
6. Refrigerate to proof overnight
7. Roll it out and make the babka


## Chocolate Filling
Note: could reduce this by ~10%, never use all of it
- 212g (3/4 cup) heavy cream (can substitude with half and half)
- 100g sugar
- pinch of salt
- 170g (6oz) bittersweet chocolate, chopped (ideally 66-74% cacao)
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 stick butter
- pinch of nutmeg

### Steps
1. Combine cream, sugar, and salt in sauce pan over heat until sugar dissolves.
2. Reduce heat (to avoid burning chocolate) and add chocolate, butter, vanilla, and nutmeg.
3. Stir over low heat until fully combined. Cool to room temp.


## Chocolate Streusel

- 60g AP flour
- 45g sugar
- 11g cocoa powder
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 4.5 tsp butter, melted
- 60g mini chocolate chips

### Steps
1. Combine everything but the chocolate chips
2. Add the chips

## Simple Syrup

- 2/3 cup sugar
- 2/3 cup water

### Steps
1. Heat equal volumes sugar and water until sugar fully dissolves.


## Assembly

1. After dough comes out of the fridge, divide in half. Repeat for each half:
2. Butter 9x5 inch loaf pan
3. Roll portion out into rectangle, roughly 9x17 inches. You have some flexibility here--generally you want the long direction to be almost 2x the length of the pan (9 inches), and the further you stretch it in the other direction, the thinner/tighter each layer will be.
4. Spread 1/2 filing over dough, leaving about 3/4 inches along the long edge at the bottom open. Rub a little water across the open edge to help seal the role (tbh this isn't as necessary here as it is for cinnamon rolls).
5. Roll down from top towards open edge to seal into a log. Highly recommend freezing log for 10mins before next step.
6. Slice log in half lengthwise from tip to tip. Rotate halves chocolate side up, then use a little more water to try to seal one end back together. Keeping the chocolate facing up, twist the two halves together like a candy cane, and place the twisted bundle into the buttered pan.
7. Proof for ~2 hrs at room temp, or until poke test passes.
8. Sprinkle little clumps of streusel on top.
9. Bake at 350 for ~45 mins.
10. Brush with 1/2 simple syrup when it comes out. Yum!
